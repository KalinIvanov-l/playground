The OPTIONAL keyword is especially helpful for exploring a new dataset which that you're not unfamiliar with.
For example, if you see that it assigns certain property values to certain resources,
remember that not all resources of that type may have those properties assigned to them.
Putting triple patterns inside OPTIONAL section lets
you retrieve values if they're there
without interfering with the retrieval of related data if those values aren't there.
